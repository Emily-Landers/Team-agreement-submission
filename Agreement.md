**Our team plans to approach day to day work with a gameplan that has been outlined and agreed upon on the previous day. We will have a list of tasks in Trello that will need to be accomplished, and check them off throughout the day as they are completed.**

## Conflict Plan

Any conflict will quickly be resolved with a team vote, and group meeting where we come together to solve a problem together. 
We will hold reasonable expectations for every team members contributions, and hold them accountable for doing their part, and listening to team mates. If anybody either doesnt let others contribute, or is not contributing the expected and agreed upon amount of work we will hold a team meetig to reiterate expectations, and try to resolve any issues ourselves and restructure our game plan. If the problems can not be resolved we will escalate the problem to JB. 

## Communication Plan

We will all be available during regular school hours, and in cases when other team members need to get ahold of eachother they can any time via slack. 
We will communicate through Slack, Remo, and Discord
Break time will be every hour or as needed, with a lunch break at 12
Everyones voice will be heard, because we will be making an active effort to remain highly communicative and have regular check ins.
We will encourage everyone to be themselves and strive to create an environment that is safe for all personality and communication types.
Every milestone and task will be tracked in Trello and checked off by individuals daily

## Git Process

All components of our project will live on github
Every member of the team had been added as a contributor and been given access to the GitHub repo
Michael will be the only person reviewing and merging PRs
Merging will happen two times a day; at lunch, and end of day
